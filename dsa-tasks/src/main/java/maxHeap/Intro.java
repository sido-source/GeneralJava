    PriorityQueue: It's like a special type of binary tree (called a binary heap) stored in an array under the hood.
    The smallest (or largest, depending on the queue type) element is always at the top (the "root").
    We can only take the smallest element one by one, not randomly like in an AVL tree.


    What will we need:
    1) PriorityQueue
    2) Comparator (we want to sort elements in a specific order)
