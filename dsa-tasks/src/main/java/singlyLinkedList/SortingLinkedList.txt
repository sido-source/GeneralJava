1. Brute Force Approach (Insertion Sort-like Approach)
In this approach, the idea is to traverse the linked list and iteratively build a new sorted list by inserting each node into its correct position in the new list.

Steps:

Create a dummy node: This dummy node will act as the head of the new sorted list.
Iterate through the original list: Start with the first node (head) and iterate through each node.
For each node, detach it from the original list (by keeping track of head.next) and then insert it into its proper position in the new sorted list.
Find the insertion point: To insert the current node into the new sorted list, traverse the new list starting from the dummy node and find the correct position where the current node should be inserted.
Insert the node: Once you find the correct position, insert the node into the sorted list.
Repeat: Continue this process for every node in the original list until all nodes are sorted and added to the new list.
Return the sorted list: After all nodes are inserted, the list starting from dummy.next is the sorted list.
Complexity:

Time Complexity: Since you are inserting each node into the sorted list, and each insertion requires traversing the sorted list (which grows in size as you add more elements), the time complexity is O(n^2).
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) (ignoring recursion stack), since you're using constant extra space besides the input list.
Limitations:

This is not an efficient solution for large lists because of its quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)).
However, it's easier to implement and may work well for smaller inputs.
2. Optimized Approach (Merge Sort)
Merge sort is the most commonly used sorting algorithm for linked lists because it divides the list into smaller parts (halves) and merges them in sorted order. It works efficiently with a time complexity of O(n log n).

Steps:

Base Case: If the list is empty (head == null) or has only one node (head.next == null), return the list since it’s already sorted.
Split the List:
Use the slow and fast pointer technique:
Slow pointer moves one step at a time, fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle of the list.
Break the list into two halves: Set prev.next = null to split the list into two parts.
Recursively Sort Both Halves:
Call the sortList recursively on the left half (head) and the right half (which starts from the middle).
Merge the Sorted Halves:
Use a helper function (merge) to merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list.
Compare nodes from both halves and attach the smaller node to the result list.
Continue until all nodes from both halves are merged into a single sorted list.
Return the Sorted List: After merging, the final list is sorted and ready to be returned.
Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(n log n) because:
You divide the list into halves, which takes O(log n) steps.
Merging the lists takes linear time O(n) in each recursion step.
Space Complexity: O(log n) due to recursion stack space used in splitting the list.
Why Merge Sort Is Efficient for Linked Lists:

Linked Lists Lack Random Access: Algorithms like quicksort rely on random access to elements, which is efficient in arrays but inefficient in linked lists.
Efficient Merging: Merging two sorted linked lists can be done in linear time because we only need to traverse both lists sequentially.
Divide and Conquer: Merge sort’s divide and conquer approach suits linked lists since splitting them into smaller lists is relatively easy with pointer manipulations.
3. Other Sorting Algorithms:
Here’s a quick overview of other sorting algorithms and their feasibility for linked lists:

1. Quick Sort:

Time Complexity: O(n log n) on average, but can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case (if the pivot selection is poor).
Space Complexity: O(log n) for recursion (best case).
Feasibility for Linked Lists:
Quick sort is not ideal for linked lists because it requires random access (for partitioning), which is inefficient in singly linked lists.
In linked lists, partitioning is not as straightforward since you can’t access elements by index.
2. Heap Sort:

Time Complexity: O(n log n).
Space Complexity: O(n) for heap storage.
Feasibility for Linked Lists:
Heap sort is also not a good choice for linked lists because it relies on array-like access to maintain the heap structure.
Linked lists do not allow efficient random access to elements, making heap sort inefficient for this data structure.
3. Bubble Sort or Selection Sort:

Time Complexity: O(n^2) for both.
Space Complexity: O(1).
Feasibility for Linked Lists:
Both bubble sort and selection sort are inefficient for large lists due to their quadratic time complexity.
However, like insertion sort, they can be implemented on linked lists with simple pointer manipulations. They are generally avoided for larger inputs due to their slow performance.
