what is wrong in this code : public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {

        Map<int[], List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (String s : strs) {
            int[] localAlph = new int[26];

            // update localAph key array
            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
                localAlph[c-'a']++;
            }
            // update map

            if (map.containsKey(localAlph) && !map.get(localAlph).isEmpty()) {
                List<String> currList = map.get(localAlph);
                currList.add(s);
                map.put(localAlph, currList);
            } else {
                map.put(localAlph, List.of(s));
            }

        }

        List<List<String>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for(Map.Entry<int[], List<String>> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            res.add(entry.getValue());
        }

        return res;
    }?




    Output
    [["ate"],["tea"],["bat"],["eat"],["nat"],["tan"]]
    Expected
    [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]





    The issue with this code lies in the way keys are stored in the HashMap. In Java, arrays use reference equality for hashCode and equals, so each int[] array is treated as a unique key even if it contains identical values. This causes the HashMap to treat different instances of int[] with the same content as different keys, resulting in incorrect grouping of anagrams.

    To fix this, you should use a data structure that implements proper equals and hashCode methods for comparing the contents of the array. Here are two common solutions:

    Convert int[] to a String Key: Convert localAlph to a String key that uniquely represents the character frequencies, such as by using Arrays.toString(localAlph).
    Use List<Integer> as a Key: Convert localAlph to a List<Integer> which has equals and hashCode implemented for comparing content.
    Here's a modified version of your code that uses the first approach, converting localAlph to a String key:
