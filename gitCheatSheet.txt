The commands --set-upstream and --set-upstream-to are functionally equivalent. They both serve to establish a tracking relationship between a local Git branch and a remote branch. The choice between them is largely a matter of personal preference.

Here's a breakdown of their usage:

git branch --set-upstream origin main: This is a shorthand for the longer form git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main. It's more concise and easier to type.
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main: This is the explicit form, providing more clarity about the operation.

git reset --soft HEAD~1 -> return to the last commit
