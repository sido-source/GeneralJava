### **What is CompletableFuture?**

`CompletableFuture` is a powerful class in Java's `java.util.concurrent` package that represents a future result of an asynchronous computation. It builds upon the `Future` interface, offering additional methods for more advanced asynchronous programming. Unlike `Future`, which only allows basic tasks like checking if the computation is complete or blocking to retrieve the result, `CompletableFuture` supports non-blocking operations, chaining of dependent tasks, combining multiple futures, and more.

### **Advantages of CompletableFuture**

1. **Asynchronous and Non-blocking**:
   - `CompletableFuture` allows you to perform tasks asynchronously and retrieve results without blocking the calling thread. You can attach callbacks to be executed when the result is available.

2. **Chaining and Combining**:
   - You can chain multiple asynchronous operations using methods like `thenApply()`, `thenCompose()`, and `thenCombine()`. This allows for building complex workflows where each step depends on the previous one.

3. **Exception Handling**:
   - `CompletableFuture` provides methods like `exceptionally()`, `handle()`, and `whenComplete()` to handle exceptions gracefully, enabling more robust error handling in asynchronous code.

4. **Fork/Join**:
   - It allows combining multiple `CompletableFutures` using methods like `allOf()` and `anyOf()`, enabling efficient handling of parallel tasks and their aggregation.

5. **Better Composition**:
   - You can easily combine multiple tasks, compose futures together, and build complex pipelines that are executed asynchronously.

### **How CompletableFuture Works**

`CompletableFuture` works by providing a mechanism to start tasks asynchronously and then register callbacks or continuation tasks to be executed when the original task completes. It uses a ForkJoinPool by default, but you can provide your own `Executor` to control how tasks are run.

#### **Basic Usage Example**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Simulate a long-running task
            sleep(1000);
            return "Hello, World!";
        });

        future.thenApply(result -> {
            return result + " from CompletableFuture";
        }).thenAccept(finalResult -> {
            System.out.println(finalResult);
        });

        // Main thread is free to do other work while the CompletableFuture runs
        System.out.println("Doing other work in the main thread...");

        // Block and wait for the final result (just to keep the program from exiting immediately)
        future.join();
    }

    private static void sleep(int ms) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(ms);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(e);
        }
    }
}
```

### **Key Methods and Patterns with CompletableFutures**

1. **Creating a CompletableFuture**:
   - `CompletableFuture.runAsync(Runnable)` – Runs a task asynchronously without returning a result.
   - `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(Supplier<T>)` – Runs a task asynchronously and returns a result.

2. **Chaining Futures**:
   - `thenApply(Function<T, R>)` – Transforms the result of a `CompletableFuture` once it completes.
   - `thenCompose(Function<T, CompletableFuture<U>>)`: Flat maps the result to another `CompletableFuture`.

3. **Combining Futures**:
   - `thenCombine(CompletableFuture<U>, BiFunction<T, U, R>)` – Combines the results of two independent futures.
   - `allOf(CompletableFuture<?>...)` – Runs multiple futures in parallel and waits for all of them to complete.
   - `anyOf(CompletableFuture<?>...)` – Returns when any of the given futures completes.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - `exceptionally(Function<Throwable, T>)` – Provides a fallback value in case of an exception.
   - `handle(BiFunction<T, Throwable, R>)` – Allows you to handle the result or the exception.
   - `whenComplete(BiConsumer<T, Throwable>)` – A callback that is executed whether the computation is successful or throws an exception.

### **Example of Chaining with Error Handling**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class CompletableFutureChaining {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Simulate a long-running task
            if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong");
            }
            return "Hello";
        }).thenApply(result -> {
            return result + " World";
        }).thenApply(result -> {
            return result + "!";
        }).exceptionally(ex -> {
            // Handle the exception and return a fallback result
            System.out.println("Exception occurred: " + ex.getMessage());
            return "Hello, Default!";
        });

        System.out.println(future.join());
    }
}
```

### **Good Practices for Using CompletableFuture**

1. **Use Appropriate Thread Pools**:
   - Always pass a custom `Executor` to `supplyAsync()` or `runAsync()` for CPU-bound or I/O-bound tasks to avoid saturating the common ForkJoinPool.

2. **Chain Futures for Complex Workflows**:
   - Use methods like `thenApply()`, `thenCompose()`, and `thenCombine()` to create clear and maintainable asynchronous workflows.

3. **Handle Exceptions**:
   - Use `exceptionally()`, `handle()`, and `whenComplete()` to gracefully handle exceptions and ensure your application is robust against failures.

4. **Avoid Blocking**:
   - Avoid calling `join()` or `get()` unless absolutely necessary, as these methods block the current thread. Instead, prefer non-blocking patterns.

5. **Combine Futures Efficiently**:
   - Use `allOf()` and `anyOf()` to manage multiple asynchronous tasks, ensuring efficient execution of parallel tasks.

### **Mini-Project Ideas Using CompletableFuture**

Here are some mini-project ideas where you can apply `CompletableFuture`:

1. **Web Scraper**:
   - Build a web scraper that fetches data from multiple websites concurrently. Use `CompletableFuture` to manage the asynchronous HTTP requests, parse the results, and aggregate the data.

2. **Stock Price Aggregator**:
   - Create an application that retrieves stock prices from different APIs concurrently. Use `CompletableFuture` to combine the results and calculate the average price or other statistics.

3. **Image Processing Pipeline**:
   - Implement an image processing pipeline where images are fetched asynchronously from a remote server, processed with filters (e.g., resizing, color correction), and then saved or displayed. Use `CompletableFuture` to chain these operations.

4. **Multi-User Chat Application**:
   - Extend the chat application concept where messages are sent and received asynchronously. Use `CompletableFuture` to manage sending, receiving, and processing messages, including logging, error handling, and retries.

5. **Asynchronous Database Access**:
   - Build an application that performs CRUD operations on a database asynchronously. Use `CompletableFuture` to handle database queries and combine results from multiple queries.

6. **File Upload System**:
   - Create a system that uploads large files in chunks asynchronously. Use `CompletableFuture` to manage each chunk's upload and combine the results when all chunks are successfully uploaded.

7. **Event-Driven Microservices**:
   - Design a set of microservices that communicate asynchronously using events. Use `CompletableFuture` to handle event processing, including chaining dependent events and handling failures.

### **Summary**

`CompletableFuture` is a versatile tool for handling asynchronous computations in Java, offering advanced features like chaining, combining tasks, and robust error handling. By following best practices and applying these concepts in real-world scenarios, you can build efficient, non-blocking, and maintainable applications that leverage the full power of modern Java concurrency.
