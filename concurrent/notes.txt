task: 2 ways of creating Thread: class CreateThread
other thoughts:
Hereâ€™s a quick list of different ways to start a thread in Java:

Implement Runnable (you've done this).
Extend Thread (you've done this).
Use ExecutorService (thread pooling and task management).
Use Callable and Future (return values from threads).
Use ThreadFactory (custom thread creation).
Use Lambda expressions (simplified thread creation).
Use CompletableFuture (async programming).
