When dealing with objects that have a more **complex structure**, such as nested objects, collections, or custom comparison rules, it can sometimes be better to **override `equals()` and `hashCode()`** manually, even for records. This ensures that your comparison and hashing logic accounts for the specific requirements of your use case.

Here’s when and why you might want to override `equals()` and `hashCode()` manually:

### 1. **Complex Fields (Nested Objects, Collections)**
By default, the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods generated by records will simply delegate the comparison and hashing logic to the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods of the fields themselves. If you have **complex fields** like nested objects, custom collections, or arrays, and they don’t have suitable implementations for these methods, you may need to override them.

For example, if you have a record that contains a list or an object of a custom class, and you want custom behavior (like ignoring certain fields or custom comparison logic), you'll need to override these methods.

#### Example: Nested Objects

```java
public record Address(String city, String street) {}

public record Person(String name, int age, Address address) {}
```

In this case:
- The default `equals()` method will use `Address`'s `equals()` method to compare two `Person` objects.
- The default `hashCode()` method will combine the hash codes of `name`, `age`, and `address`.

If the `Address` class’s `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods behave appropriately (which they would in this case because it's also a record), this works fine. However, if `Address` is a more complex class with custom comparison logic, or if you want to compare `Person` objects ignoring certain fields, you’ll need to override `equals()` and `hashCode()` yourself.

### 2. **Custom Comparison Rules**
If you want to compare objects based on **custom business logic** (for example, ignoring case in string comparisons or ignoring certain fields in the equality check), the default behavior of records won’t suffice. You’ll need to manually override the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods to incorporate your logic.

#### Example: Ignoring Case in String Comparison

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (!(o instanceof Person other)) return false;
        return this.age == other.age && this.name.equalsIgnoreCase(other.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name.toLowerCase(), age);  // Use lowercase to match case-insensitive equals
    }
}
```

In this example, we override `equals()` to make the name comparison **case-insensitive** and modify `hashCode()` accordingly. This ensures that two `Person` objects with the same name in different cases are considered equal, and they generate the same hash code.

### 3. **Handling Collections and Arrays**
If your object contains fields that are **collections** (like `List`, `Set`, or `Map`) or **arrays**, you may need to override `equals()` and `hashCode()` to ensure correct behavior, especially if the default behavior doesn’t align with your intended logic.

- For **collections**, `List`, `Set`, and `Map` already provide appropriate implementations of `equals()` and `hashCode()`, but sometimes you may want to compare collections differently (e.g., ignoring order in a `List`).

- For **arrays**, the default `equals()` method in Java **compares references**, not the contents of the array. You might want to compare arrays based on their contents using `Arrays.equals()`.

#### Example: Handling Arrays

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public record Person(String name, int age, String[] hobbies) {
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (!(o instanceof Person other)) return false;
        return this.age == other.age
                && this.name.equals(other.name)
                && Arrays.equals(this.hobbies, other.hobbies);  // Compare arrays by contents
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age, Arrays.hashCode(hobbies));  // Use Arrays.hashCode for arrays
    }
}
```

In this case, we override `equals()` to compare the `hobbies` array by its **contents** using `Arrays.equals()`, and we override `hashCode()` to use `Arrays.hashCode()` to generate a consistent hash code based on the array contents.

### 4. **Ignoring Certain Fields in Equality**
Sometimes you might want to **ignore certain fields** in the equality check. The default behavior in records compares all fields, but if you want to omit certain fields (e.g., a transient or computed field that doesn’t impact equality), you’ll need to override `equals()` and `hashCode()`.

#### Example: Ignoring a Field

```java
public record Person(String name, int age, String country) {
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (!(o instanceof Person other)) return false;
        return this.age == other.age && this.name.equals(other.name);  // Ignore country in equals
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age);  // Ignore country in hashCode
    }
}
```

Here, `equals()` and `hashCode()` only consider `name` and `age`, and ignore `country` when comparing objects or computing the hash code.

### 5. **Performance Considerations**
In cases where the fields of a record are large objects (e.g., large collections or complex structures), you may need to carefully design `equals()` and `hashCode()` for **performance reasons**. For instance, computing a hash code based on a large `List` might be inefficient, so you may want to use a summary or cached value for the hash code instead.

### 6. **Consistency Between `equals()` and `hashCode()`**
Whenever you override `equals()`, it’s essential to also override `hashCode()` to maintain the **contract between `equals()` and `hashCode()`**:
- If two objects are considered **equal** by `equals()`, they **must** have the same `hashCode()`.
- If two objects have the same `hashCode()`, they **might** be equal, but this is not guaranteed.

This contract ensures that objects behave correctly in collections like `HashMap` or `HashSet`, which rely on both `equals()` and `hashCode()` for proper functioning.

### Summary of When to Override `equals()` and `hashCode()`

1. **Complex Fields**: If your object has nested objects or collections, and you need custom logic to compare them or handle edge cases (like arrays or custom collection behavior).

2. **Custom Comparison Rules**: When you need to enforce business rules like ignoring case in strings, skipping certain fields, or handling null values in a specific way.

3. **Collections and Arrays**: By default, arrays compare by reference, and collections may need specific behavior, such as ignoring order or handling null values in custom ways.

4. **Ignoring Fields**: If you want to exclude certain fields from the equality check (e.g., fields used for logging or tracking purposes).

5. **Performance**: If computing the default `hashCode()` or `equals()` involves large or complex data structures, you may want to optimize it for performance.

### Example: Advanced `Person` Class with Overrides

```java
import java.util.Objects;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Arrays;

public record Person(String name, int age, List<String> hobbies, String[] addresses) {

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (!(o instanceof Person other)) return false;
        return this.age == other.age
            && this.name.equalsIgnoreCase(other.name)  // Case-insensitive name comparison
            && Objects.equals(this.hobbies, other.hobbies)  // Handle nulls and compare list contents
            && Arrays.equals(this.addresses, other.addresses);  // Compare array by content
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name.toLowerCase(), age, hobbies, Arrays.hashCode(addresses));
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `equals()` and `hashCode()` handle:
  - **Case-insensitive name comparison**.
  - **Null-safe comparison** for `hobbies`.
  - **Array comparison** using `Arrays.equals()` and `Arrays.hashCode()`.

This ensures that objects are compared based on your specific logic, making the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods robust for complex objects.

### Conclusion

While the **default `equals()` and `hashCode()`** methods generated for Java records are usually sufficient for simple cases, you should consider overriding them when:
- You have **complex structures** like collections, arrays, or nested objects.
- You need **custom comparison rules**.
- You want to **ignore certain fields**.
- You need to handle **performance optimizations** for large or complex objects.

By overriding these methods, you ensure that your objects behave correctly according to your specific requirements in data comparisons and hash-based collections.
