use while loop if the algo needs something custom way of iterating, like

use for loop when we have iterate one by one and it is it, like we have to see all elements to find something

# EXAMPLE 1

while ( ) {

    // for example rows
    for () { }

    // for example columns
    for() { }

    // some extra logic with pointers
}


# EXAMPLE 2

for () {

    // sliding window, we shrink the left pointer, for example the current sum is too big, we encountered some duplicate of the char/letter
    while () {

    }

}



# EXAMPLE 3
        // for with external pointer


        int indexS = 0;

        for (Character c : t.toCharArray()) {
            if (s.charAt(indexS) == c) {
                indexS++;
                if (indexS == s.length()){
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
