we got huge size array of ints as argument to the function
we have to iterate and in case of negative number add it to the response List if it would be positive number,
then we have to delete the k - index from the response List, for example if response List has size 3 and we encountered
the "1" then the first element from the response List should be deleted


Make and function which will return the response List in efficient wat
