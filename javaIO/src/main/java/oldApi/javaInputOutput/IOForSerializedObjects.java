public class IOForSerializedObjects {

 /*
 ObjectInputStream
Purpose:

ObjectInputStream is used for deserializing Java objects that were serialized and written to an OutputStream. It reads Java objects from a stream and reconstructs them in memory.
Use Cases:

Object Serialization: When you need to deserialize Java objects that have been serialized using ObjectOutputStream.
Data Persistence: For reading complex data structures or objects from a file or network stream.
Remote Communication: Often used in distributed systems where objects are sent over the network.
