public class IOinMemoryByteArrays {

    /*
    ByteArrayInputStream
    Purpose:

    ByteArrayInputStream is used when you need to create an InputStream from an in-memory byte array. It allows you to read bytes from a byte array as if they were coming from an input stream.
    Use Cases:

    Testing: Useful for testing purposes where you want to simulate an input stream with predefined data.
    Data Manipulation: When you have byte data in memory that you want to process using stream-based APIs.
    In-Memory Processing: When you need to process data that is already available in a byte array without having to write it to a file or other storage first.
